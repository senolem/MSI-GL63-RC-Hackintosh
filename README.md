# MSI GL-63 RC Hackintosh
Kexts and other stuff for MSI GL63-RC on Opencore 0.8.1 and macOS Big Sur

Working : Everything but touchpad is a little bit laggy, any help would be appreciated.
HDMI is finally working! You may need to turn OFF/ON your monitor to be able to detect it.
Note : I didn't mapped USB-C and jack ports yet, you will have to do the mapping again.

I fixed sleep by setting hibernatemode at 25 :
`sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25`
